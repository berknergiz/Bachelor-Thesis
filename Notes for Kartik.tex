1) I wrote some sentences I wasn't sure about in red so that you can easily find them and tell me if rather good or not.

2) I presented and explained all the results in the Green's method results section (4.1) and started the Discussion part (4.2). Please let me know what you think of the physiological result discussion for mesenteric artery and the tumor 2. I wrote some red stuff here where I wanted to get your feedback.

3) I decided to add the NetNodesSegs glomerulus output of Green's which didn't work well at the end of the results section and discussed it/explained what the plot is and what didn't work when running the code.
-->> Please let me know if this seems good to you or if I should move the figure to the Appendix as we basically discussed it.

4) I added the 4 glomeruli in the DuMuX section and will discuss things rather creatively as you suggested. Please have a look at the glom-pictures. I would be very happy to get a feedback and maybe some ideas about what else to add/what you think is missing in this section once I am done with this part (tomorrow).
