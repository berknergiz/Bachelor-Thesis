- I wrote some sentences I wasn't sure about in red so that you can easily find them and tell me if rather good or not.

- I decided to add the glomerulus output of Green's which didn't work well at the end of the results section and discussed it/explained what the plot is and what didn't work when running the code.
-->> Please let me know if this seems good to you or if I should move the figure to the Appendix as we basically discussed it.

- I added the 4 glomeruli in the DuMuX section and discussed things rather creatively as you suggested. I would be very happy to get a feedback and maybe some ideas about what else to add from you in this section.
