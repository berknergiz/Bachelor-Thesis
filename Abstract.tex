\section*{Abstract}

%Oxygen is carried by red blood cells in the blood. It is supplied to organs, muscles and generally to the tissue through a complex network of blood vessels that range from milli- to micro- meter in size. This microvascular network consists of micro-sized capillaries, that can be extracted from ex vivo mice organs. This work is performed in the context of the NCCR Kidney.CH project, which aims to develop computational models for the computation of gradients of oxygen in the renal tissue, and associate them with activity of cells for better understanding of kidney physiology. The specific goals of the thesis are to study oxygen transport and pressure gradients in capillary networks using computational methods.

This thesis aims to understand and specify how blood flow and oxygen transport has been simulated until today. The goal is to see how far existing methods, especially the Green's function method applied to this field by Secomb et al. \cite{Secomb2004} can produce accurate results for new and especially complex networks. A new model using an open source software called $DuMu^x$ \cite{flemischdumux} was implemented to offer a different approach for oxygen transport and diffusion simulations.\\
