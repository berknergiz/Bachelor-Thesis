\section{Acknowledgements}
\label{s:Acknowledgements}

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor Kartik Jain for helping me build a good understanding of both the topic and the used tools, and supporting me during the project with great advice. In addition to helping me gain a good knowledge about subject-specific contents, he helped me gain an insight into research on a high-level. While being very demanding, he taught me to pay attention to the crucial details, and especially showed me how to convert ambition into good work by his own example.
\\The time I spend at the $Interface$ $Group$ was a valuable experience, which will surely help me in my future work. I think that I gained a considerable amount of new knowledge, as working inside the group gave me a particularly interesting insight into how things are being done in academic research on a high-level.\\
\\I would like to thank everyone for integrating me in the group and making the work for this bachelor thesis both interesting and very enjoyable.\\
\\Finally, I would like to thank Vartan Kurtcuoglu for offering me the possibility of doing my thesis in the group, and taking the time to supervise me.
