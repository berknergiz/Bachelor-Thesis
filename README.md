# Bachelor-Thesis
Uploading the most actual versions of the LaTeX code of my Bachelor Thesis

Please do a git clone to https://github.com/berknergiz/Bachelor-Thesis.git and run the article.tex file with TexShop on your Mac.

I included the compiler code in the beginning of most of the files, so GreatWork.tex can be compiled directly with TexShop as well, but will open and compile the article.tex file to produce a pdf-file called article.pdf
